This repository is part of the paper: Y. Zhang and S. H. Strogatz, _Designing temporal networks that synchronize under resource constraints_.

The repository includes:
1. `direct_simulation.m`

  _MATLAB code for simulating optoelectronic oscillators on temporal networks (reproducing Fig.6 in the paper)._

2. `floquet.m`

  _MATLAB code for calculating the Floquet exponents of Stuart-Landau systems (reproducing Fig.3b in the paper)._
